Utilize Bash looping to iteratively create each user account and their directories.

    Design a basic FOR Loop that iteratively alters the file system and user entries in a passwd-like file for new users: LARRY, CURLY, and MOE.
    Each user should have an entry in the $HOME/passwd file
    The userid and groupid will be the same and can be found as the sole contents of a file with the user's name in the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY.txt might contain 123)
    The home directory will be a directory with the user's name located under the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY)
        NOTE: Do NOT use shell expansion when specifying this in the $HOME/passwd file.
    The default shell will be /bin/bash
    The other fields in the new entries should match root's entry
    Users should be created in the order specified
