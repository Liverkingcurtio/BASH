    Find all executable files under the following four directories:
        /bin
        /sbin
        /usr/bin
        /usr/sbin
    Sort the filenames with absolute path, and get the md5sum of the 10th file from the top of the list.


tenth="$(find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin -executable -type f | sort | head -10 | tail -1)" ; md5sum "$tenth" | awk '{print $1}'
