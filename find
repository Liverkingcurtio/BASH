sing find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.
Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file name from the absolute path output.
Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.
You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use. Have each path displayed only once.

find -type f -name '*.bin' | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="/"}{NF--; print}' |  sort -u
